# Lazy386 kernel<br>
The Lazy386 kernel is a lightweight monolithic kernel coded in Turbowarp, meant to rival [Microconsen](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/695370/). You can modify this kernel in order to create your own operating system. It is open source, meaning everyone can view and contribute to it. It features:
 - Working [rxFS](https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=https://extensions.turbowarp.org/0832/rxFS2.js) filesystem
 - Optimized for low-end devices
 - Easy to understand user interface
 - Command-line interface
