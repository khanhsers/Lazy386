# 🧩 Lazy386 kernel<br>
The Lazy386 kernel is a lightweight monolithic kernel coded in Turbowarp, meant to rival [Micro Consen](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/695370/). You can modify this kernel in order to create your own operating system. It is open source, meaning everyone can view and contribute to it. It features:
 - Working [rxFS](https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=https://extensions.turbowarp.org/0832/rxFS2.js) filesystem
 - Optimized for low-end devices
 - Easy to understand user interface
 - Command-line interface
# 💻 System requirements
Here are the required system specs in order for Lazy386 to smoothly run:
 - 2GB RAM or more (4GB reccomended)
 - Chromium, WebKit or Gecko browser engine (Chromium reccomended)
 - Windows, macOS, Linux or any operating system capable of running a Chromium-based or Gecko-based browser
 - 480x360 (4:3) resolution display or higher
 - Mouse and keyboard
